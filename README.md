# 📞 Call Transcript Summary & Sentiment Analyzer

A **Flask-based mini project** that analyzes customer call transcripts using the **Groq API**.  

The app automatically:  
- Summarizes the conversation in **2–3 sentences**  
- Extracts detailed **sentiment** → overall polarity *(Positive / Negative / Neutral / Mixed)* and tone(s) *(e.g., Angry, Frustrated, Polite, Grateful, etc.)*  
- Saves results into a CSV file for review  

---

## ✨ Features
- Simple **web UI** for entering transcripts  
- Real-time **summary + sentiment analysis**  
- Structured JSON ensures **consistent output**  
- Automatic CSV logging in `outputs/call_analysis.csv`
